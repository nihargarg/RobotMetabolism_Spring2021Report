abstract = {The field of modular self-reconfigurable robotic systems addresses the design, fabrication, motion planning, and control of autonomous kinematic machines with variable morphology. Modular self-reconfigurable systems have the promise of making significant technological advances to the field of robotics in general. Their promise of high versatility, high value, and high robustness may lead to a radical change in automation. Currently, a number of researchers have been addressing many of the challenges. While some progress has been made, it is clear that many challenges still exist. By illustrating several of the outstanding issues as grand challenges that have been collaboratively written by a large number of researchers in this field, this article has shown several of the key directions for the future of this growing field},

In this simulation, the spontaneous and continuous emergence of large numbers of simple self-replicating molecube structures is observed without any explicit selection for this behavior. A quantitative comparison of structures' self-replicability is investigated using a universal self-replication metric (Bryant and Lipson 2003), as well as the existence of interacting structure groups. Because of the discrete nature of the simulation and simple interactions, it bears strong resemblance to nonuniform cellular automata.},

abstract = {In this article we examine the problem of dynamic self-reconfiguration of a class of modular robotic systems referred to as metamorphic systems. A metamorphic robotic system is a collection of mechatronic modules, each of which has the ability to connect, disconnect, and climb over adjacent modules. A change in the macroscopic morphology results from the locomotion of each module over its neighbors. Metamorphic systems can therefore be viewed as a large swarm of physically connected robotic modules that collectively act as a single entity. What distinguishes metamorphic systems from other reconfigurable robots is that they possess all of the following properties: (1) a large number of homogeneous modules; (2) a geometry such that modules fit within a regular lattice; (3) self-reconfigurability without outside help; (4) physical constraints which ensure contact between modules. In this article, the kinematic constraints governing metamorphic robot self-reconfiguration are addressed, and lower and upper bounds are established for the minimal number of moves needed to change such systems from any initial to any final specified configuration. These bounds are functions of initial and final configuration geometry and can be computed very quickly, while it appears that solving for the precise number of minimal moves cannot be done in polynomial time. It is then shown how the bounds developed here are useful in evaluating the performance of heuristic motion planning/reconfiguration algorithms for metamorphic systems.},

@article{Aloupis2013,
abstract = {Modular robots consist of many identical units (or atoms) that can attach together and perform local motions. By combining such motions, one can achieve a reconfiguration of the global shape of a robot. The term modular comes from the idea of grouping together a fixed number of atoms into a metamodule, which behaves as a larger individual component. Recently, a fair amount of research has focused on algorithms for universal reconfiguration using Crystalline and Telecube metamodules, which use expanding/contracting cubical atoms. From an algorithmic perspective, this work has achieved some of the best asymptotic reconfiguration times under a variety of different physical models. In this paper we show that these results extend to other types of modular robots, thus establishing improved upper bounds on their reconfiguration times. We describe a generic class of modular robots, and we prove that any robot meeting the generic class requirements can simulate the operation of a Crystalline atom by forming a six-arm structure. Previous reconfiguration bounds thus transfer automatically by substituting the six-arm structures for the Crystalline atoms. We also discuss four prototyped robots that satisfy the generic class requirements: M-TRAN, SuperBot, Molecube, and RoomBot. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Rubenstein2014,
abstract = {In current robotics research there is a vast body of work on algorithms and control methods for groups of decentralized cooperating robots, called a swarm or collective. These algorithms are generally meant to control collectives of hundreds or even thousands of robots; however, for reasons of cost, time, or complexity, they are generally validated in simulation only, or on a group of a few tens of robots. To address this issue, this paper presents Kilobot, an open-source, low cost robot designed to make testing collective algorithms on hundreds or thousands of robots accessible to robotics researchers. To enable the possibility of large Kilobot collectives where the number of robots is an order of magnitude larger than the largest that exist today, each robot is made with only {\$}14 worth of parts and takes 5 min to assemble. Furthermore, the robot design allows a single user to easily operate a large Kilobot collective, such as programming, powering on, and charging all robots, which would be difficult or impossible to do with many existing robotic systems. We demonstrate the capabilities of the Kilobot as a collective robot, by using a small robot test collective to implement four popular swarm behaviors: foraging, formation control, phototaxis, and synchronization. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Xu2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by ASME. A wide range of engineering applications, ranging from civil to space structures, could benefit from the ability to construct material-efficient lattices that are easily reconfigurable. The challenge preventing modular robots from being applied at large scales is mainly the high level of complexity involved in duplicating a large number of highly integrated module units. We believe that reconfigurability can be more effectively achieved at larger scales by separating the structural design from the rest of the functional components. To this end, we propose a modular chainlike structure of links and connector nodes that can be used to fold a wide range of two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) structural lattices that can be easily disassembled and reconfigured when desired. The node geometry consists of a diamondlike shape that is one-twelfth of a rhombic dodecahedron, with magnets embedded on the faces to allow a forceful and selfaligning connection with neighboring links. After describing the concept and design, we demonstrate a prototype consisting of 350 links and experimentally show that objects with different shapes can be successfully approximated by our proposed chain design.},

This paper presents a distributed and parallel mechanism for decentralized self-reconfiguration of MSR robots. This mechanism is hybrid by combining Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) describing the topological structure as configuration target and Cellular Automata (CA) for local motion planning of individual modules. Turtle interpretations are extended to modular robotics for generating module-level predictions from global description. According to local information, independent modules make motion planning by Cellular Automata in parallel. This distributed mechanism is robust to failure of modules, scalable to varying module numbers, and convergent to predefined reconfiguration targets. Simulations and statistical results are provided for validating the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {This paper presents a homogeneous modular robot system design based on four per-module degrees of freedom (DOF), including a prismatic DOF to increase the versatility of its reconfiguration and locomotion capabilities. The ModRED (Modular Robot for Exploration and Discovery) modules are developed with rotary-plate genderless single sided docking mechanisms (RoGenSiD) that allow chain-type configurations and lead towards hybrid-type configurations. Various locomotion gaits are simulated through the Webots robot simulator and implemented in the real ModRED system. This work also addresses the problem of dynamic reconfiguration in a modular self-reconfigurable robot (MSR). The self-reconfiguration problem is modeled as an instance of the graph-based coalition formation problem. We formulate the problem as a linear program that finds the "best" partition or coalition structure among a set of ModRED modules. The technique is verified experimentally for a variety of settings on an accurately simulated model of the ModRED robot within the Webots robot simulator. Our experimental results show that our technique can find the best partition with a reasonably low computational overhead. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The system can change its configuration by changing each module's position and connection. Each module is equipped with an onboard microprocessor, actuators, intermodule communication/power transmission devices and intermodule connection mechanisms. The special design of M-TRAN module realizes both reliable and quick self-reconfiguration and versatile robotic motion. For instance, M-TRAN is able to metamorphose into robotic configurations such as a legged machine and hereby generate coordinated walking motion without any human intervention. An actual system with ten modules was built and basic operations of self-reconfiguration and motion generation were examined through experiments. A series of software programs has also been developed to drive M-TRAN hardware, including a simulator of M-TRAN kinematics, a user interface to design appropriate configurations and motion sequences for given tasks, and an automatic motion planner for a regular cluster of M-TRAN modules. These software programs are integrated into the M-TRAN system supervised by a host computer. Several demonstrations have proven its capability as a self-reconfigurable robot.},

These robots, capable of operating either individually or in a group, also possess the structural modular morphology that enables them to adapt to the unstructured nature of a real environment. Over the past two decades, significant work has been published in this field, particularly in the aspects of autonomy, mobility and docking. This paper reviews the primary methods in the literature related to the fields of modular and reconfigurable mobile robotics. By bringing together aspects of modularity, including docking and autonomy, and synthesizing the most relevant findings, there is optimism that a more complete understanding of this field will serve as a starting ground for innovation and integration of such technology in the urban environment. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We present a modular robot design inspired by the creation of complex structures and functions in biology via deformation. Our design is based on the Tensegrity model of cellular structure, where active filaments within the cell contract and expand to control individual cell shape, and sheets of such cells undergo large-scale shape change through the cooperative action of connected cells. Such deformations play a role in many processes, e.g. early embryo shape change and lamprey locomotion. Modular robotic systems that replicate the basic deformable multicellular structure have the potential to quickly generate large-scale shape change and create dynamic shapes to achieve different global functions. Based on this principle, our design includes four different modular components: (1) active links, (2) passive links, (3) surface membranes, and (4) interfacing cubes. In hardware implementation, we show several self-deformable structures that can be generated from these components, including a self-deformable surface, expandable cube, terrain-adaptive bridge [C.-H. Yu et al., 2007]. We present experiments to demonstrate that such robotic structures are able to perform real time deformation to adapt to different environments. In simulation, we show that these components can be configured into a variety of bio-inspired robots, such as an amoeba-like robot and a tissue-inspired material. We argue that self-deformation is well-suited for dynamic and sensing-adaptive shape change in modular robotics.},

An MSR system can change its shape to suit the task, whether it is climbing through a hole, rolling like a hoop, or assembling a complex structure with many arms. These systems have three promises: Versatility The ability to reconfigure allows a robot to disassemble and/or reassemble itself to form morphologies that are well-suited for a variety of given tasks. Robustness Since the system is composed of many repeated parts which can be rearranged during operation, faulty parts can be discarded and replaced with an identical module on-the-fly, leading to self-repair. Low cost MSR systems can lower module costs since mass production of identical unit modules has an economic advantage that scales favorably. Also, a range of complex machines can be made from a set of modules saving the cost versus having multiple single-function machines for doing different tasks.},

The heterogeneous systems areemployedto demonstrate the feasibilityof reconfigurableandmodular systems for lunarpolar crater exploration missions. All systems have been designed with a common electromechanical interface, allowing to tightly interconnect all these systems to a single system and also to form new electromechanical units.With the different strengths of the respective subsystems, a robust and flexible overall multirobot system is built up to tackle the, to some extent, contradictory requirements for an exploration mission in a crater environment. In RIMRES, the capability for reconfiguration is explicitly taken into account in the design phase of the system, leading to a high degree of flexibility for restructuring the overall multirobot system. To enable the systems' capabilities, the same distributed control software architecture is applied to rover, scout, and payload items, allowing for semiautonomous cooperative actions as well as full manual control by a mission operator. For validation purposes, the authors present the results of two critical parts of the aspired mission, the deployment of a payload and the autonomous docking procedure between the legged scout robot and the wheeled rover. This allows us to illustrate the feasibility of complex, cooperative, and autonomous reconfigurationmaneuvers with the developed reconfigurable team of robots.},

The connection between the modules is genderless and instant, since the internal magnet can freely attract other FreeBOT spherical ferromagnetic shells, and not need to be precisely aligned with the specified connector. This connection method has fewer physical constraints, so the FreeBOT system can be extended to more configurations to meet more functional requirements. FreeBOT can accomplish multiple tasks although it only has two motors: module independent movement, connector management and system reconfiguration. FreeBOT can move independently on the plane, and even climb on ferromagnetic walls; a group of FreeBOTs can traverse complex terrain. Numerous experiments have been conducted to test its function, which shows that the FreeBOT system has great potential to realize a freeform robotic system.},
